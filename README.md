# VenomChat - Blockchain Made Easy with Venom

## üí° Inspiration 

Blockchain is complicated. Did you know that although 10% of adult Americans (33 million!) intend to buy their first crypto asset, 36% of US citizens are not familiar with cryptocurrencies, and 29% find it too complicated to understand?*

That's why we made VenomChat! ü§ñ

## ‚ùì What it does

VenomChat is a platform-agnostic solution that addresses the high barrier of entry to blockchain via an intuitive chatbot, making Web3 easier than ever. Mint Venom NFTs, and get answers to Web3-related questions across web, mobile, Discord, Slack, and Telegram! 

## üöß How we built it 

Venom Smart Contracts: 

Empowering users to access Venom's network across web, mobile, Discord, Slack, and Telegram.
